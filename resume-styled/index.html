  <!--Start of paragraph about Marcello-->
  <p class="para-bio"> Marcello Carelli, a rising junior at the <b>University of Miami's Frost School of Music</b>, is <em>well</em> on his way to becoming one of the busiest drummers in town.
    Majoring in Studio Music and Jazz, Carelli was chosen as a <strong>Stamps Distinguished Ensembles Scholar</strong> to perform in a prestigious Jazz Quintet for all four years as an undergraduate.
    Marcello has also played in the <strong>Frost Concert Jazz Band</strong> and the <strong>Brian Lynch Artist Ensemble</strong>, the other two <i>top groups</i> at Frost directed by two <em>Grammy Award-winning</em> faculty members.</p>
  <p class="para-bio"> Originally from Bedford Hills, New York, Carelli has already played with many esteemed artists including Brian Lynch, Dave Liebman, Ira Sullivan, John Daversa, Andy Fusco, and Walt Weiskopf.
    He has traveled to places such as Italy, Surinam, New Orleans, California, and Colorado to perform at well-known jazz festivals, compete, and educate other aspiring
    young musicians. Marcello is a product of many fine teachers, the <strong>most notable</strong> one being Dafnis Prieto, <i>2011 MacArthur Fellow</i> and <i>2019 Grammy Award-winning</i> drummer and composer.
    Some of his greatest influences are Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakey, Al Harewood, Joe Henderson, Roy Hargrove, Greg Hutchinson, and Eric Harland. </p>
