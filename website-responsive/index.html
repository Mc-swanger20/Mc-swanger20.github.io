        <h4>Breaking News</h4>
        <p><u>March 17, 2020</u> - As a result of the COVID-19 Virus, all ACC Sports have decided to postpone all games to keep everyone safe.
          Hopefully, the season will continue by mid-May and will extend through early-August.</p>
        <p><u>March 11, 2020</u> - Cane Baseball barely sneaks past the UCF Knights 3-2 thanks to the bats of Raymond Gil and Alex Toral along
          with the stellar pitching of Alex McFarlane and Daniel Federman.

        <h4>History of the Canes</h4>
        <p> Welcome to the homepage of the Miami Hurricanes Baseball Squad. Founded in 1940, the Hurricanes have made it to
          the College World Series 25 times, and they have taken the National Championship 4 times (1982, 1985, 1999, 2001).
          This was not an easy feat, as Miami has had to play against an extremely difficult ACC Conference, but with the help
          of coaches such as Ron Fraser (30 seasons) and Jim Morris (25 seasons), the Canes prevailed over their opponents
          with numerous Conference Championships and College World Series trips.</p>
        <p> Canes Baseball is extremely confident going into the 2020 season as their 2019 recruiting class was ranked 15th
          in the <i>Collegiate Baseball Newspaper</i> rankings during the offseason. Their class was ranked #1 in the ACC by
          <i>Baseball America</i>. Adrian Del Castillo and Alex Toral were awarded Preseason All-American First and Second
          Team by <i>Collegiate Baseball</i>. They are currently ranked #7 in the top 25 according to <i>D1 Baseball</i>, and
          if the season continues, they have a great shot at going all the way in the NCAA D1 tornament and College World Series.

        <h4>About Maniac</h4>

        <p>Ever wonder why you don't see Sebastian the Ibis dancing on top of the dugout at every Hurricanes Baseball game? Well
          that's because the Miami Maniac, who only appears at the baseball games, was a vision of former coach Ron Fraser and
          was created in 1982. The idea actually originated at the University of South Carolina, being named "Cocky," and Orofino
          High School in Orofino, Idaho has a similar looking mascot as well. Because of Maniac's strong school spirit and
          ability to get the fans hyped up, he has been asked to perform at the College World Series and other baseball
          events on ESPN.
